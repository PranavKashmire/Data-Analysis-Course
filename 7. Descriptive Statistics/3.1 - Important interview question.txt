note :
why is sample variance divided by n-1 ??
- ans in image 3
-It is also called as bassel correction .

- bassel correction  : The Bessel correction is a statistical adjustment used in the calculation of sample variance and standard deviation. It accounts for the fact that a sample statistic tends to underestimate the true population variance. This correction ensures an unbiased estimate of the population variance.

-  In a sample, using 
𝑛
n (without correction) underestimates the population variance because the sample mean 
𝑥
ˉ
x
ˉ
  is itself an estimate. The correction (dividing by 
𝑛
−
1
n−1) compensates for this bias.
